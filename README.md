# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation is to learn the basics of the bootcamp, in particular the JavaScript, Git Bash and Git flow using Git Hub.
The notes highlight some key code or reminders that I believed were important
